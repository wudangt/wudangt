### Glad to see you here! &nbsp; ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=wudangt.wudangt)

I am a full-stack developer, and designer. I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D at a university.

As a researcher, I like representation learning, generative modeling, and deep learning. I am also interested in using information-theoretic approaches to improve upon existing deep generative models, and in its application to semi-supervised learning. That's why I like to make things that make a difference.
